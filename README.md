# Pelagios API Developer Tutorial

These examples illustrate how you can use the [Pelagios API](http://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-api-v3) 
to build your own Web mashups. The tutorial requires knowledge of JavaScript, and it helps if you have used 
a Web mapping library before. But otherwise, things should work out-of-the-box.

## Running the Examples

If you have a GitHub account, you can clone the repository. Otherwise, 
[download the whole project as a Zip](https://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-api-tutorial/archive/master.zip),
and unpack at a convenient location.

There are two examples in the project:
