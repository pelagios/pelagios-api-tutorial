# Pelagios API Developer Examples

These examples illustrate how you can use the [Pelagios API](http://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-api-v3) 
in your own Web mashups and applications. The examples require knowledge of JavaScript, and it helps if you 
have used a Web mapping library before. But otherwise, things should Just Work.

## Running the Examples

If you have a GitHub account, clone this repository. Otherwise, 
[download the whole project as a Zip](https://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-api-tutorial/archive/master.zip),
and unpack at a convenient location. There are two examples in the project:

### Example 1: Mapping the Spatial Footprint of a Document

This example uses the [search functionality of the Pelagios API](https://github.com/pelagios/pelagios-api-v3/blob/master/README.md#searching-the-api)
to retrieve objects and map their geographical outlines on a map. Most objects on the Pelagios API have a "footprint" of just a single coordinate
(e.g. because they are archaeological items, coins, etc.). But the literary works from the [Pelagios 3 collection](http://pelagios.org/api-v3/pages/datasets/2a10228dff4c608b91a953efff8dafb3f5c433035b3f31e687eec0297d799824)
typically cover a larger area.

The example searches the API for the terms _'Homer'_ and _'Herodotus'_, grabs the search results' [convex hulls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull)
from the JSON responses and overlays them on map in different colours in order to visualize their different spatial focus. The
example uses the [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) Web mapping library, along with suitable base layer maps developed by the
[Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire](http://imperium.ahlfeldt.se/) and the  
[Ancient World Mapping Center](http://awmc.unc.edu/wordpress/tiles/map-tile-information).

Open the file ``tutorial-map.html`` with your browser to run the example. The relevant code to look at & tweak
is in the file [tutorial-map.js](tutorial-map.js).

### Example 2: Placing Objects on a Timeline

The second example uses the API to fetch objects that match the search query _'bronze AND coin'_, and which are dated
between 700BC and 800AD. The objects' timestamps (either a single year or an interval) are then used to 
construct an interactive timeline, using the [vis.js](http://visjs.org/) visualization library.

Open the file ``tutorial-timeline.html`` with your browser to run the example. Relevant code is 
in the file [tutorial-timeline.js](tutorial-timeline.js).

## What Next?

Some things you could do next:

1. Try playing around with the features of the Pelagios API. For example: try plotting the footprints 
of all datasets; improve map popups, so that they link back to the original source of the data; make use 
of the thumbnail URLs included with some of our objects; are there any other datasets you know of you
could mash up with Pelagios API?

2. Try different visualization approaches & tools. E.g.: how about visualizing search results in 
[GeoTemCo](https://github.com/stjaenicke/GeoTemCo)?

3. Come up with something cool? Have more ideas? [Let us know](http://twitter.com/pelagiosproject)!
